# Pokémon Battle Simulator
A small fun side project I built in Python using Pygame.
The goal was to combine my love of programming and Pokémon in order to create a simple turn-based Pokémon battle simulator. This was done purely for practice and enjoyment, and is in no way intended to be a full fan game.

# Overview
This is a lightweight Pokémon Battle Simulator where you pick between one of the Gen 1 starters (and Pikachu, duh!) and face off against a random Gen 1 starter opponent.

The game features:
- A main menu for Pokémon selection.
- A basic turn-based battle system with HP bars and move buttons.
- Cleanly organized scenes (main menu, battle, game over).
- Static sprites of classic Pokémon.

As should be clear from the above, there’s plenty of room for further extensions if desired.
